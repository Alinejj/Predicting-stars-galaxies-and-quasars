# Predicting-stars-galaxies-and-quasars
This project is a machine learning application that classifies celestial objects as Stars, Galaxies, or Quasars based on their photometric attributes. Using a labeled dataset of celestial objects, the project builds and evaluates classification models while visualizing the decision-making process.

#Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and standardizes the input data for efficient model training.
- Multiple Classification Models: Implements Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- Performance Evaluation: Analyzes model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Interactive Predictions: A function to predict the object type based on user-defined inputs.
- Decision Tree Visualization: Graphical representation of the decision-making process.

#Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier: Visualized to understand the decision-making process.
- Logistic Regression: Offers insights into linear separability of classes.
- K-Nearest Neighbors: Leverages proximity to classify objects.

#Visualization
The project includes:
- Pair Plot: Displays relationships between key features.
- Class Distribution: Highlights the balance of labels in the dataset.
- Decision Tree: A visual representation of the Decision Tree Classifier.
